## For Vanessa
Vanessa, this section is for you. Feel free to dig in, modify, and experiment as you see fit.

## Project Contents

## Data Notes
> - **Notice the missing values for the year 2001?**
> - **That's something we inherited from the original dataset.**
> - **Keep an eye on that as you analyze.**

## Model Options
We're debating between multiplicative and additive models for data decomposition. Check out the results for both in:
