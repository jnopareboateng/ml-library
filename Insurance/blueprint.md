### Blueprint:
**Data Preprocessing**:
Clean and merge the datasets (SICLIFE, MMC, and data_policy) based on common variables (e.g., assured name, policy number).
Handle missing values and inconsistencies.
Transform variables into suitable formats for analysis.

**Descriptive Statistics**:
Calculate summary statistics (means, medians, modes, standard deviations) for key variables (premium, sum assured, age, etc.).
Visualize distributions using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.

**Inferential Statistics**:
Conduct regression analysis to investigate the relationship between factors (gender, occupation, branch, etc.) and life insurance premium pricing.
Perform ANOVA or t-tests to compare premium rates between term, endowment, and whole life insurance policies.

**Model Building**:
Develop a predictive model (e.g., linear regression, decision tree) to estimate premium rates based on significant factors.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like R-squared, mean absolute error, and mean squared error.

**Results Interpretation**:
Analyze and interpret the results in the context of the research questions.
Identify key findings, trends, and correlations.

**Task List**:

**Data Cleaning**:
Merge datasets using common variables (assured name, policy number).
Handle missing values (imputation, deletion, or replacement).
Resolve inconsistencies in data formatting.

**Data Transformation**:
Convert date variables to a standard format.
Create new variables (e.g., age, tenure) from existing ones.

**Descriptive Statistics**:
Calculate summary statistics for key variables.
Visualize distributions using appropriate plots.

**Regression Analysis**:
Conduct simple and multiple regression analyses to investigate factor relationships.
Evaluate model assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity, normality).

**ANOVA/t-tests**:
Compare premium rates between policy types (term, endowment, whole life).
Evaluate significance levels and effect sizes.

**Model Building**:
Develop a predictive model using significant factors.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

**Results Interpretation**:
Analyze and interpret findings in the context of research questions.
Identify key trends, correlations, and insights.

**Additional Tasks**:

**Literature Review**:
Research existing studies on life insurance premium pricing and policy types.
Identify gaps in current knowledge and how your study contributes to the field.

**Data Visualization**:
Create informative and engaging visualizations to communicate findings.

**Report Writing**:
Compile a comprehensive report detailing the research process, methodology, results, and conclusions.
