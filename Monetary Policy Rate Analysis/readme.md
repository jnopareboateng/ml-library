# Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Forecasting Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on data analysis, machine learning, and forecasting techniques. Each project is designed to explore different approaches and methodologies, providing valuable insights and practical applications in various domains.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the projects, it's essential to set up your development environment. Follow these steps to create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**

It's recommended to create a separate virtual environment for each project to maintain a clean and isolated environment. You can create a virtual environment using `venv` or `conda`, depending on your preference.

```bash
# Using venv
python -m venv .venv

# Using conda
conda create --name myenv python=3.9
```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

After creating the virtual environment, you need to activate it.

- On Windows:

```bash
# Using venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Using conda
conda activate myenv
```

- On Unix or macOS:

```bash
# Using venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Using conda
conda activate myenv
```

3. **Install Required Packages**

Each project has its own `requirements.txt` file listing the required packages. Navigate to the project directory and install the packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Descriptions

### [Crude Oil Forecast](crude-oil-forecast/readme.md)

This project focuses on forecasting Brent Crude Oil prices in Ghana using a combination of models, including ARIMA, XGBoost, and RF Regressor. The main analysis is performed in the [`arimav3.ipynb`](crude-oil-forecast/arimav3.ipynb) notebook, while the random forest implementation can be found in [`rf.ipynb`](crude-oil-forecast/rf.ipynb).

The project utilizes two datasets:

- [`Commodity Prices Monthly.csv`](crude-oil-forecast/Commodity Prices Monthly.csv)
- [`Modified_Data.csv`](crude-oil-forecast/Modified_Data.csv)

### [Telecel](telecel/)

The Telecel project is centered on using machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn on the Telecel network based on student data from the KNUST campus. This project aims to provide insights into customer behavior and develop strategies to retain customers.

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models.
  - `telecel_data.csv`: The dataset containing customer information and churn labels.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
  - `data_exploration.ipynb`: Notebook for exploring and visualizing the dataset.
  - `data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for cleaning and preprocessing the data.
  - `model_development.ipynb`: Notebook for training and evaluating various machine learning models.
- `models/`: This directory stores trained machine learning models for future use.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the required Python packages and their versions.

To get started with the Telecel project, follow these steps:

### [FCC Python](fcc_python/)

This project is a collection of certification projects based on Freecodecamp's Python certification course. It covers various topics and challenges, providing an opportunity to practice and improve Python programming skills.

The project is organized into separate directories, each containing a README file with instructions and requirements for the specific project. The directories include:

- `arithmetic_arranger/`: A project focused on creating a function that arranges arithmetic problems vertically and side-by-side.
- `budget_app/`: A project involving the development of a command-line budget application.
- `polygon_area_calculator/`: A project that calculates the area of regular polygons based on the provided side lengths.
- `probability_calculator/`: A project that calculates the probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat.
- `time_calculator/`: A project that adds or subtracts a duration from a given time.

To work on a specific project, follow these steps:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment as described in the "Getting Started" section.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd fcc_python/<project_directory>`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Follow the instructions in the project's README file to complete the challenges.

### [MPR](mpr/)
