## Note for Vanessa ðŸ«¡ðŸ«¡
> Vanessa, this note is specifically for you. Feel free to explore and make tweaks as you wish.

## Project Files
The main file that contains our work is `tsa.ipynb`. 

## Data Preprocessing
I have preprocessed the data into a format suitable for time series analysis.

## Model Selection
I are uncertain about which variant of modeling to use for decomposing the data: multiplicative or additive. Therefore, I have included the results of both models for your consideration.

- `additive model.png` - Results of the additive model.
- `multiplicative model.png` - Results of the multiplicative model.

## Contact
